            <article>

                ASP.NET Core supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern,
                which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes
                and their dependencies. <br> <br>


                A dependency is any object that another object requires. Examine the following <b>MyDependency class</b>
                with a WriteMessage method that other classes in an app depend upon:
                <p>
                    <code>
                        public class MyDependency
                        {
                        public MyDependency()
                        {
                        }

                        public Task WriteMessage(string message)
                        {
                        Console.WriteLine(
                        $"MyDependency.WriteMessage called. Message: {message}");

                        return Task.FromResult(0);
                        }
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>

                An instance of the MyDependency class can be created to make the WriteMessage
                method available to a class. The MyDependency class is a dependency of the IndexModel class:
                <p>
                    <code>
                        public class IndexModel : PageModel
                        {
                        MyDependency _dependency = new MyDependency();

                        public async Task OnGetAsync()
                        {
                        await _dependency.WriteMessage(
                        "IndexModel.OnGetAsync created this message.");
                        }
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>

                The class creates and directly depends on the MyDependency instance.
                Code dependencies (such as the previous example) are problematic and should be avoided for the following
                reasons:

                <li> To replace MyDependency with a different implementation, the class must be modified. </li>
                <li> If MyDependency has dependencies, they must be configured by the class. In a large project with
                    multiple classes depending on MyDependency, the configuration code becomes scattered across the app.
                </li>
                <li> This implementation is difficult to unit test. The app should use a mock or stub MyDependency
                    class, which isn't possible with this approach.
                </li>

                <blockquote> Each services.Add{SERVICE_NAME} extension method adds (and potentially configures)
                    services.
                    For example, services.AddMvc() adds the services Razor Pages and MVC require. We recommended that
                    apps
                    follow this convention. Place extension methods in the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
                    namespace
                    to encapsulate groups of service registrations. </blockquote>

                If the service's constructor requires a built in type, such as a string, the type can be injected by
                using configuration or the options pattern:

                <p> <code> public class MyDependency : IMyDependency
                        {
                        public MyDependency(IConfiguration config)
                        {
                        var myStringValue = config["MyStringKey"];

                        // Use myStringValue
                        }

                        ...
                        }</code></p>

                An instance of the service is requested via the constructor of a class where the service is used and
                assigned
                to a private field. The field is used to access the service as necessary throughout the class.<br>

                In the sample app, the IMyDependency instance is requested and used to call the service's WriteMessage
                method:

                <p>
                    <code>
                        public class IndexModel : PageModel
                        {
                        private readonly IMyDependency _myDependency;

                        public IndexModel(
                        IMyDependency myDependency,
                        OperationService operationService,
                        IOperationTransient transientOperation,
                        IOperationScoped scopedOperation,
                        IOperationSingleton singletonOperation,
                        IOperationSingletonInstance singletonInstanceOperation)
                        {
                        _myDependency = myDependency;
                        OperationService = operationService;
                        TransientOperation = transientOperation;
                        ScopedOperation = scopedOperation;
                        SingletonOperation = singletonOperation;
                        SingletonInstanceOperation = singletonInstanceOperation;
                        }

                        public OperationService OperationService { get; }
                        public IOperationTransient TransientOperation { get; }
                        public IOperationScoped ScopedOperation { get; }

                        public IOperationSingletonInstance SingletonInstanceOperation { get; }

                        public async Task OnGetAsync()
                        {
                        await _myDependency.WriteMessage(
                        "IndexModel.OnGetAsync created this message.");
                        }

                When a service collection extension method is available to register a service
                (and its dependent services, if required), the convention is to use a single
                Add{SERVICE_NAME} extension method to register all of the services required by
                that service. The following code is an example of how to add additional services
                to the container using the extension methods AddDbContext, AddIdentity, and AddMvc:

                <p>
                    <code>
                        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
                        {
                        services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                            options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

                            services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
                                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
                                    .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

                                    services.AddMvc();
                                    }
                    </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Service_lifetimes">
            <header>Service_lifetimes</header>
            <article>
                Choose an appropriate lifetime for each registered service.
                ASP.NET Core services can be configured with the following lifetimes: <br>
                <li> Transient</li>
                Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested from the service container.
                This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.
                <li> Scoped</li>
                Scoped lifetime services are created once per client request (connection).
                <li> Singleton</li>
                Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they're requested (or when ConfigureServices
                is run and an instance is specified with the service registration). Every subsequent request uses
                the same instance. If the app requires singleton behavior, allowing the service container to manage
                the service's lifetime is recommended. Don't implement the singleton design pattern and provide user
                code to manage the object's lifetime in the class.

                <br><br>
                <b> Constructor injection behavior</b>
                Services can be resolved by two mechanisms:
                <li>
                    IServiceProvider
                </li>
                <li>
                    ActivatorUtilities – Permits object creation without service registration in the
                    dependency injection container. ActivatorUtilities is used with user-facing abstractions,
                    such as Tag Helpers, MVC controllers, and model binders.
                </li> <br><br>
                Constructors can accept arguments that aren't provided by dependency injection,
                but the arguments must assign default values. <br>
                When services are resolved by IServiceProvider or ActivatorUtilities,
                constructor injection requires a public constructor.<br>

                    Entity Framework contexts are usually added to the service container using the scoped lifetime
                    because
                    web app database operations are normally scoped to the client request. The default lifetime is
                    scoped if
                    a lifetime isn't specified by an AddDbContext<TContext> overload when registering the database
                        context.
                        Services of a given lifetime shouldn't use a database context with a shorter lifetime than the
                        service.

                <p>To demonstrate the difference between the lifetime and registration options, consider the following
                    interfaces that represent tasks as an operation with a unique identifier, OperationId. Depending on
                    how the lifetime of an operations service is configured for the following interfaces, the container
                    provides either the same or a different instance of the service when requested by a class:

                    <code> public interface IOperation
                        {
                        Guid OperationId { get; }
                        }

                        public interface IOperationTransient : IOperation
                        {
                        }

                        public interface IOperationScoped : IOperation
                        {
                        }

                        public interface IOperationSingleton : IOperation
                        {
                        }

                        public interface IOperationSingletonInstance : IOperation
                        {
                        }</code>

                    The interfaces are implemented in the Operation class. <br>
                    The Operation constructor generates a GUID if one isn't supplied:

                    <code>
                        public class Operation : IOperationTransient,
                        IOperationScoped,
                        IOperationSingleton,
                        IOperationSingletonInstance
                        {
                        public Operation() : this(Guid.NewGuid())
                        {
                        }

                        public Operation(Guid id)
                        {
                        OperationId = id;
                        }

                        public Guid OperationId { get; private set; }
                        }</code>

                    An OperationService is registered that depends on each of the other Operation types.
                    When OperationService is requested via dependency injection, it receives either a new
                    instance of each service or an existing instance based on the lifetime of the dependent service.
                    <br>
                    <li> When transient services are created when requested from the container, the OperationId of
                        the IOperationTransient service is different than the OperationId of the OperationService.
                        OperationService receives a new instance of the IOperationTransient class. The new instance
                        yields a different OperationId.</li>

                    <code>
                        public class OperationService
                        {

                    Create an IServiceScope with IServiceScopeFactory.CreateScope to resolve a scoped service
                    within the app's scope. This approach is useful to access a scoped service at startup to run
                    initialization tasks. The following example shows how to obtain a context for the MyScopedService
                    in Program.Main: <br>
                    <code>
                        public static void Main(string[] args)
                        {
                        var host = CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build();

                        using (var serviceScope = host.Services.CreateScope())
                        {
                        var services = serviceScope.ServiceProvider;

                        try
                        {
                        var serviceContext = services.GetRequiredService<MyScopedService>();
                            // Use the context here
                            }
                            catch (Exception ex)
                            {
                            var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
                                logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred.");
                                }
                                }

                                host.Run();
                                }</code></p>

                <p> When the app is running in the Development environment, the default service provider performs checks
                    to verify that:
                    <li>
                        Scoped services aren't directly or indirectly resolved from the root service provider.
                    </li>
                    <li> Scoped services aren't directly or indirectly injected into singletons.</li>
                    <br>
                    The root service provider is created when BuildServiceProvider is called. The root service
                    provider's
                    lifetime corresponds to the app/server's lifetime when the provider starts with the app and is
                    disposed
                    when the app shuts down. <br><br>
                    Scoped services are disposed by the container that created them. If a scoped service is created in
                    the
                    root container, the service's lifetime is effectively promoted to singleton because it's only
                    disposed
                    by the root container when app/server is shut down. Validating service scopes catches these
                    situations
                    when BuildServiceProvider is called.

                    The services available within an ASP.NET Core request from HttpContext are exposed through the
                    HttpContext.
                    RequestServices collection. <br> <br>

                    Request Services represent the services configured and requested as part of the app. When the
                    objects
                    specify dependencies, these are satisfied by the types found in RequestServices, not
                    ApplicationServices.<br> <br>

                    Generally, the app shouldn't use these properties directly. Instead, request the types that
                    classes require via class constructors and allow the framework inject the dependencies. This yields
                    classes
                    that are easier to test.<br> <br>

                Best practices are to:
                    <li>Design services to use dependency injection to obtain their dependencies.</li>
                    <li>Avoid stateful, static method calls.</li>
                    <li>Avoid direct instantiation of dependent classes within services. Direct instantiation couples
                        the code to a particular implementation.</li>
                    <li>Make app classes small, well-factored, and easily tested.</li>
                    <br><br>

                    If a class seems to have too many injected dependencies, this is generally a sign that
                    the class has too many responsibilities and is violating the Single Responsibility
                    Principle (SRP). Attempt to refactor the class by moving some of its responsibilities
                    into a new class. Keep in mind that Razor Pages page model classes and MVC controller
                    classes should focus on UI concerns. Business rules and data access implementation details
                    should be kept in classes appropriate to these separate concerns. <br> <br>

                    <b>Disposal of services
                    </b><br>
                    The container calls Dispose for the IDisposable types it creates. If an instance is added
                    to the container by user code, it isn't disposed automatically.

                    <code>

                <p>  The built-in service container is meant to serve the needs of the framework and most

                    that it doesn't support. Some of the features supported in 3rd party containers not found in
                    the built-in container: <br>
